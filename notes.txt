Let's think of how to approach this

I need to create a restful API

It needs to see the page content and store what is found in the h1, h2, h3 tags, and all links. It will do this by parsing the source code (HTML)

One point needs to get the URL to parse, the other end stores all URLs and the content that's in the DB
